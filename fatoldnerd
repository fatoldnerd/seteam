# SE Team System (Claude Code)

A Claude Code–powered Sales Engineering Operating System: shared context + templates, role-based subagents, and slash commands that generate consistent, deal-ready artifacts (discovery, demo plan, security responses, implementation handoff) with guardrails to prevent invented claims and keep sensitive data out of git.

## What this gives the team
- Repeatable, standardized deliverables per deal
- Faster post-call turnaround (less admin, more selling)
- Cleaner SE → Delivery handoffs (scope, risks, integrations, success criteria)
- Built-in governance (assumptions flagged, no capability fabrication)

## Repo structure
- `CLAUDE.md` – system rules + routing hints
- `context/` – product, competitive, security posture (source of truth)
- `templates/` – reusable deliverable formats
- `.claude/agents/` – subagents (research, discovery synthesis, demo, security, handoff)
- `.claude/commands/` – slash commands (workflows)
- `deals/` – per-account deal workspaces (keep sensitive data out of git)
- `output/` – generated outputs (optional)

## Quick start (for an SE)
1) Open this repo in **Claude Desktop** (Claude Code → Local) or **Cursor** (Claude Code enabled).
2) Create a deal workspace:
   - Run: `/new-deal <AccountName>`
3) In the new deal folder, add inputs:
   - `inputs/deal-context.md` (fill out)
   - Add call notes or a transcript to `inputs/`
4) Generate the post-call package:
   - Run: `/post-call-package`
5) Review and send:
   - `outputs/discovery-summary.md`
   - `outputs/demo-plan.md`
   - `outputs/next-step-email.md`

## Subagents (capabilities)
- `deal-researcher` – pre-call brief, context, discovery questions
- `discovery-synthesizer` – call notes/transcript → structured discovery summary
- `demo-architect` – discovery → demo flow + talk track + success criteria
- `security-responder` – security questionnaire drafts + data-flow narrative (no over-claiming)
- `handoff-writer` – implementation handoff with scope, integrations, risks, acceptance criteria

## Data safety / rules
- Do **not** commit sensitive customer information.
- Store sensitive artifacts in:
  - `deals/**/private/` or `deals/**/attachments/` (ignored by git)
  - `CLAUDE.local.md` (local-only, ignored by git)
- If the system is unsure, it must label content as **Assumption** or **To be confirmed**.

## Customization checklist (admin)
- Update:
  - `context/product-overview.md`
  - `context/competitive-notes.md`
  - `context/security-posture.md`
- Tighten templates in `templates/` to match your team’s standards.
- Add new workflows as slash commands in `.claude/commands/`.

## Troubleshooting
- If agents/commands aren’t recognized:
  - Ensure you opened Claude Code from the repo root (this folder)
  - Restart the Claude Code session
- If outputs go to the wrong place:
  - Confirm you are working inside the intended deal folder
  - Re-run with explicit paths in your request
