# Discovery Summary — AcmePlumbing — 2025-12-22


## Executive snapshot (max 5 bullets)
- Mid-sized plumbing contractor with 80 techs, growing fast
- Dispatch inefficiency and delayed job updates causing operational drag
- Invoicing errors impacting cash flow and customer trust
- Looking for faster scheduling, cleaner billing, better field visibility
- Decision timeline: 6 weeks


## Customer context
- Industry: Plumbing / Field Services
- Operating model (how work flows): Dispatch assigns jobs via spreadsheets + legacy FSM; techs receive updates with delays; job completion triggers manual invoicing
- Current tools: Spreadsheets + legacy FSM system
- What prompted evaluation now: Growth is outpacing current tooling; manual processes creating bottlenecks


## Pain + impact
- Current process: Manual dispatch via spreadsheets, delayed field updates, error-prone invoicing
- Friction points:
  - Dispatch inefficiency slows tech utilization
  - Job status updates lag behind reality
  - Invoicing errors require rework and delay payment
- Impact (time, cost, risk, revenue): Admin overhead, missed revenue from scheduling gaps, customer dissatisfaction from billing errors


## Desired outcomes (future state)
- Faster, smarter scheduling to maximize tech utilization
- Real-time job visibility for dispatch and management
- Clean, accurate billing integrated with accounting


## Decision process
- Stakeholders + roles:
  - Ops Director (Champion) — owns daily workflow
  - CFO (Economic Buyer) — cares about billing accuracy and ROI
  - IT Manager (Security) — will evaluate integration and data handling
- Decision owner: CFO (economic buyer)
- Timeline: Decision in 6 weeks
- Budget: Not discussed
- Procurement / legal / security steps: Not discussed


## Success criteria (what "good" looks like)
- Reduce admin time by 30%
- Improve first-time fix rate
- Integrate with existing accounting system


## Risks / open questions
- Implementation owner unclear — **We still need** to identify who will own rollout internally
- Data migration concerns — **We still need** to scope legacy data volume and migration path


## Next steps (owner + date)
- Schedule demo focused on dispatch + billing workflow — **We still need** to confirm date and attendees
- Identify implementation owner before demo — AcmePlumbing to confirm
