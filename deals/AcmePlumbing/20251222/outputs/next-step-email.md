**Subject:** AcmePlumbing + [Company] — Next Steps

Hi [Ops Director Name],

Thanks for the conversation today. It was helpful to hear how dispatch delays, invoicing errors, and limited field visibility are slowing things down as you scale.

Here's what I took away:

- **Core pain:** Manual dispatch and legacy FSM can't keep pace with 80 techs and growing
- **Desired outcome:** Faster scheduling, accurate billing, and real-time job visibility
- **Success criteria:** 30% reduction in admin time, improved first-time fix rate, accounting integration

**Proposed next steps:**

1. **Demo** — Walk through dispatch → field → billing workflow tailored to your operations. We'll show how the 30% admin savings would actually happen.
2. **Technical deep-dive** — Cover integration with your accounting system, data migration from your legacy FSM, and security review with your IT Manager.

Before we schedule, it would help to confirm:
- Who will own implementation internally?
- Can you share a sample data export from your current system for migration scoping?

I'll send a few time options for the demo early next week. Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best,
[Your Name]
