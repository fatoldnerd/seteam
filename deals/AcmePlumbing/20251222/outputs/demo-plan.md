# Demo Plan — AcmePlumbing — 2025-12-22


## Demo objective (1 sentence)
Show AcmePlumbing how modern dispatch and billing workflows eliminate manual overhead and give leadership real-time visibility into field operations.


## Audience + what they care about
- Ops Director (Champion): Faster scheduling, fewer firefighting calls, happier techs
- CFO (Economic Buyer): Clean invoicing, reduced admin costs, measurable ROI
- IT Manager (Security): Integration feasibility, data security, migration path


## Narrative arc
1) Current state pain: Spreadsheets + legacy FSM = delayed updates, dispatch bottlenecks, invoicing errors
2) Future state workflow: Dispatch sees real-time availability → assigns jobs in clicks → techs get instant updates → job completion triggers accurate invoice
3) Proof (features only in service of workflow): Smart scheduling, mobile tech app, automated invoicing, accounting integration
4) Confidence (security, implementation, ROI): Data handling overview, migration approach, 30% admin time savings path


## Demo flow (time-boxed)
- 0–5 min: Recap discovery pain points; confirm these are still top priorities
- 5–15 min: Dispatch workflow — show scheduling board, drag-drop assignment, real-time tech availability
- 15–25 min: Field workflow — tech mobile experience, job updates, parts/notes capture
- 25–35 min: Billing workflow — job completion → invoice generation → accounting sync
- 35–45 min: Q&A, confirm success criteria alignment, discuss next steps


## Talk track (what to say)
- Opening framing: "Last call you mentioned dispatch delays, invoicing errors, and visibility gaps. Today we'll walk through how a typical job flows from assignment to payment — and where you'd save that 30% admin time."
- Transition lines:
  - "Now that dispatch has assigned the job, let's follow the tech into the field..."
  - "The job is complete — here's where billing used to break down. Watch what happens now..."
- Close: "You mentioned wanting a decision in 6 weeks. To hit that, we'd suggest a technical deep-dive next, then a pilot scope discussion. Does that align with how you'd want to move forward?"


## "Show me" moments
- Drag-drop scheduling with real-time tech availability
- Tech mobile app receiving instant job update
- One-click invoice generation from completed job
- Accounting system sync (or mock if integration not live)


## Success criteria to confirm live
- "Does this dispatch flow match how your ops team would actually use it?"
- "If invoicing worked this way, would that address the errors you're seeing?"
- "What would 'good' look like for the accounting integration?"


## Likely objections + responses
- "Our legacy data is a mess" → "We've migrated similar contractors; let's scope your data volume and clean-up needs in a technical call."
- "Our techs aren't tech-savvy" → "The mobile app is designed for field use — large buttons, offline mode, minimal typing. We can show adoption stats from similar customers."
- "What about security?" → "We'll cover data handling, SSO options, and compliance in the technical deep-dive with your IT Manager."


## CTA
- Next meeting purpose: Technical deep-dive with IT Manager to cover integration, security, and data migration
- What we need from them:
  - Confirm implementation owner before next call — **We still need** this identified
  - Share sample data export from legacy FSM (if available) for migration scoping
