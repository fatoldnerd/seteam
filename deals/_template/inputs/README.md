# Deal Inputs (How to use this folder)

## Required
- deal-context.md (keep this updated)

## Call notes naming (required)
Create a new file for every customer interaction:

- call-01-discovery.md
- call-02-demo.md
- call-03-technical.md
- call-04-exec.md

## Why this matters
The /call-synthesis command uses these files to:
- capture what changed
- update current-deal-state.md
- keep the deal progression coherent
