# Security posture (edit carefully)


## Authentication & access
- SSO:
- MFA:
- RBAC:
- Audit logging:


## Data handling
- Data in transit:
- Data at rest:
- Backups:
- Data retention:


## Compliance & attestations
- SOC 2:
- ISO 27001:
- GDPR:
- Subprocessors:


## Safe standard language
- “We can provide documentation under NDA.”
- “We will confirm details with our security team where needed.”
- “If not explicitly documented here, treat as To Be Confirmed.”
